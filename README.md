# Data-Visualization

This is my Module 5 submission it consists of my code, the csv files used and my analysis of my code in a txt file.

Note;I did not pull and push to git I added them manually once again, they worked for me so I hope they work for you.

Note; I received guidance from Learning assistants when I didn tget the desired plot and i also refereed to stack overflow for formatting assistance in relation to my plots.

Note; there might be some nonsense data in my code only because I was playing around with it trying to find out different ways to the end solution.
